# Traceability or transparency is a much more useful metric to try and optimize than replicability

Given that [[Replicability in the humanities is very nuanced and complex and hard and annoying]], should we just accept that humanities research is too multidimensional and give up on any attempts to inject the secret open science sauce into it? Luckily not, my dear straw-person! 

We can usefully distinguish replicability or reproducability from *transparency*, which involves the following:
