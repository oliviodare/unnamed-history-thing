"With co-producers of data and meaning, protocols are never set in stone, reporting guidelines are necessarily local and consent is always fluid" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/groups/4474011/items/KTF5S3NK?page=1}{de Rijcke and Penders 2018:29})

\emph{I’m not exactly sure what they mean with “extracting meaning from interactive kinds”: given the example above it’s something like getting information about the author and their worldview from their work. A conclusion you would make in an art-whatever paper might be “X expresses the author’s view on Y”. But is the “unreplicability” of this due to the kind of subject studied, or due to the methodology? 

But the methodology is what you would want to replicate right, so maybe the argument is that we cannot make the methodology of interpretation precise enough to be replicable, or at least not without losing the value of doing so, or that doing so is not very interesting.

Hmm.\\

  note = {TJ: Humanities which rely on digital analysis (bit broader that digital humanities, which (to me) is more doing that, rather than citing results from a DH paper) have problems reproducing these things because:
\par
a) datasets are not or cannot always be easily opened
\par
b) methods are obscure to non-DH people
\par
c) publishing DH has the problem that you want to publish it in journals relevant to the thing under study (Joyce) but those journals are not interested in the technical details, but you end up publishing in DH journals whose readers care less about the specific topic.}

  abstract = {A large number of scientists and several news platforms have, over the last few years, been speaking of a replication crisis in various academic disciplines, especially the biomedical and social sciences. This paper answers the novel question of whether we should also pursue replication in the humanities. First, I create more conceptual clarity by defining, in addition to the term “humanities,” various key terms in the debate on replication, such as “reproduction” and “replicability.” In doing so, I pay attention to what is supposed to be the object of replication: certain studies, particular inferences, of specific results. After that, I spell out three reasons for thinking that replication in the humanities is not possible and argue that they are unconvincing. Subsequently, I give a more detailed case for thinking that replication in the humanities is possible. Finally, I explain why such replication in the humanities is not only possible, but also desirable.},

This project was initiated in response to concerns about the openness and trustworthiness of science. Though applicable and valuable in many fields, here we argue that this value cannot be extended everywhere, since the epistemic content of fields, as well as their accountability infrastructures, differ. Furthermore, we argue that there are limits to replicability across all fields; but in some fields, including parts of the humanities, these limits severely undermine the value of replication to account for the value of research.},

Although qualitative research is rarely published in the high-impact journals that have adopted, or are most likely to adopt, data sharing policies, qualitative researchers who publish work in these and similar venues will likely encounter questions about data sharing within the next few years. The fundamental ways in which qualitative and quantitative data differ should be considered when assessing the extent to which qualitative and mixed methods researchers should be expected to adhere to data sharing policies developed with quantitative studies in mind. We outline several of the most critical concerns below, while also suggesting possible modifications that may help to reduce the probability of unintended adverse consequences and to ensure that the sharing of qualitative data is consistent with ethical standards in research.},

He shows that standards of replication are, of course, social, and that there is consequently no outside standard, no Archimedean point beyond society from which we can lever the intellects of our fellows."—Donald M.
