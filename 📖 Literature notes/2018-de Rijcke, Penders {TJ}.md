I’m not exactly sure what they mean with “extracting meaning from interactive kinds”: given the example above it’s something like getting information about the author and their worldview from their work. A conclusion you would make in an art-whatever paper might be “X expresses the author’s view on Y”. But is the “unreplicability” of this due to the kind of subject studied, or due to the methodology? 
  
But the methodology is what you would want to replicate right, so maybe the argument is that we cannot make the methodology of interpretation precise enough to be replicable, or at least not without losing the value of doing so, or that doing so is not very interesting.  
  
Hmm.

Nice, concrete claim, but is it tho
