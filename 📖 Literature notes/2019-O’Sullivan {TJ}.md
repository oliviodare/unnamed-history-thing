# The humanities have a ‘reproducibility’ problem

## Reading notes

### TJ 

Humanities which rely on digital analysis (bit broader that digital humanities, which (to me) is more doing that, rather than citing results from a DH paper) have problems reproducing these things because: 

a) datasets are not or cannot always be easily opened 

b) methods are obscure to non-DH people 

c) publishing DH has the problem that you want to publish it in journals relevant to the thing under study (Joyce) but those journals are not interested in the technical details, but you end up publishing in DH journals whose readers care less about the specific topic.
