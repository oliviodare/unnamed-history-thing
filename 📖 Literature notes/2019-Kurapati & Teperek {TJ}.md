# What does reproducibility mean for qualitative research?


Summary of a talk concering replicability in the hums.

Two most interesting claims are as follows

## Distinction between replication, reproduction, and transparency.

> \[Sebastian\] presented lucid definitions of the various terms that are often used interchangeably.
> 1.  **Reproducibility**: Using same data and methods to produce same results
> 2.  **Replicability**: Using same methods, different data/sample and arriving at same results
> 3.  **Transparency**: Providing all necessary information to evaluate a study

Unclear whether this is an analysis of how these terms are used or whether they are propositions, but as usual with these kinds of distinctions it probably claims to be the former but is more fruitfully interpreted as a proposal.

I am unsure about what "arriving at same results" is supposed to mean for replicability, but I take an example to be doing a survey about some sociological thing in a different group of people (say, not university students ðŸ¤¯) and seeing that the thing holds.

If that is the intended meaning, I think this is a very fruitful distinction. Reproduction as checking whether the actual experiment (or whatever humanities equivalent) is performed soundly, and replication for checking whether the theory tested holds up to scrutiny. 



## Call for transparency (= traceability?) as open science "metric" in humanities

> Therefore, Sebastian suggested that the rigour and quality of qualitative research should not be judged based on reproducibility or replicability, but by the transparency of the research process.
>
> He distinguished three types of transparency most relevant in qualitative research:
>
> 1.  **Production transparency**: Information on how data are collected or generated, such as research questions, sampling, subject recruitment; this information should be recorded following best practices in the research field.
> 2.  **Analytic transparency**: Documentation process of qualitative data preparation and analysis leading to the conclusions of a study.
> 3.  **Data access**: Considerations with regards to data sharing and access conditions.

I believe 1. most coincides with Martijn's conception of "traceability", namely making very clear where certain archival papers are found. It also includes 3 somewhat, in that sharing this data would in effect make the data already much more accessible.

I personally am more interested in 2: how do all the data combine to form the final result?

I think this is a very fruitful distinction and I am inclined to agree with this.

[[traceability or transparency is a much more useful metric to try and optimize than replicability]]
