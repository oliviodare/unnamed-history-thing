# Replicability and replication in the humanities
**Take-home message**:  A case for encouraging replication studies in the humanities.

## Reading notes



> The issue of replicability and replication in academic research is important for various reasons. Let me mention four of them: (i) results that are consistently replicated are likely to be true, all else being equal, that is, controlling for such phenomena as publication bias and assuming that the other assumptions in the relevant theory or model are valid, (ii) replicability prevents the waste of (financial, time, etc.) resources, since studies that cannot be consistently replicated are less likely to be true, (iii) results that are not replicable are, if they are applied, more likely to cause harm to individuals, animals, and society (e.g., by leading to mistaken economic measures or medicine that is detrimental to people’s health), and (iv) if too many results turn out not to be replicable, upon attempting to replicate them, that will gradually erode public trust in science.7

 The reasons for why replicability (in general) is desirable. Ok.

> possible


Here the author goes on to describe some of the criticism that may be thrown to the idea of replicability in the humanities, concretely, why replication is not possible (or at least, not a meaning of ‘replication’ directly exportable form the natural sciences). In short, these are the criticism he is 'against' ("It remains to be seen, though, whether these objections hold water. I return to each of them below"):  

- one-time historical phenomena, unable to replicate.  
- hermeneutical methods: how are those replicable, when we involve a human agent in it?  
- objects of study have meaning and value  

Now, could we take this set of criticism to say that the natural sciences have, at least, some of those characteristics too, and they still engage in 'replication' activities: for instance, there is a level of *interpretation* in the natural sciences, although it may not be apparent or event presented as such, but the natural science do work with interpreting (if not texts, natural data). Also, it's not like the natural sciences don't engage with meaning and value, is just that they hide it under the auspices of 'objectivity'.  



From this observation, we may say two things:  

a) thus the criticism on why the humanities cannot do replication cannot rest on this assumptions.  


b) since meaning, value, and so on are not what differentiates humanities and natural sciences, and if we are to create a humanities-specific notion of replication, in which agency, value, and meaning play a role, the natural sciences should look at this notion to understand how replication interacts with meaning, value, and so on. 
*(TJ: Counterpoint: this is what [[2018-de Rijcke, Penders {TJ}]] claim, that one of the core distinctions between humanities and physical sciences * is * the kind of objects they extract meaning from, and hence the kind of meaning they extract.)*

> Also, I take “replication” and “reproduction” to be synonyms, as I do “replicability” and “reproducibility.”13

 This may be problematic.
 *(TJ: [[2019-Kurapati & Teperek {TJ}]] explicitly makes this distinction, taking replication to be using the same method on a different dataset, while reproducing being trying to reproduce the exact experiment. Not sure I agree, seems somewhat arbitrary as I don't think scholars use these words that distinctively, but as a proposal it seems reasonable.)*

> What this goes to show is that replication is a matter of degree and that in assessing the epistemic status of a replication, one should try to locate it on a replication continuum

 Good. I wonder the link with Harry Collin's ideas.

> First, we should note that it follows from the definitions of “replicability” and “replication” given in this section that both replicability and replication are a matter of degree.29

 main take-away so far

> However, this objection fails for two reasons. On the one hand, many study objects in the humanities do have multiple instances. On the other hand, quite a few study objects in the empirical sciences are unique. As to the former: Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse is unique, but it is also one of many instances of novels using a stream-of-consciousness-narrative technique; the French Revolution is unique, but it is an instance of a social revolution, of which the American Revolution in 17751783 and the Russian Revolution in 1917 are other examples. Magdalen College library can be compared to other college libraries in Oxford, to other libraries across the country, and to other buildings in the late fifteenth century. And so on.

 This clearly must show that, despite finding **analogous** phenomena in the humanities objects of study, replication *cannot* mean the same thing!!

> Thus, the idea that the empirical sciences study phenomena that have multiple instances, whereas the humanities study unique phenomena is, as a general claim, untenable.

 Sure, but that is not the reason why replication shoud be implemented in the same way in the humanities. The argument does not rest on this.

> Take the hermeneutical method. Does reading a text again make it, all else being equal, likely that one’s interpretation is correct? It seems to me the answer here has to be positive. There are at least two reasons for that. First, one may have made certain mistakes in one’s original reading and interpretation: faulty reading, sloppy analysis, forgetting relevant passages, and so on, on the first occasion may play a role. If one’s second interpretation differs from the first, one will normally realize that and revisit the relevant passage, comparing which of the two interpretations is more plausible.

 The historical disciplines, for example, have been 'correcting' for this not through a direct exportation of the natural sciences concept of replication, but the method and art of historiography.

> carefully re-reading a passage with relevant new background beliefs and coming to the same result increases the likelihood of truth of one’s interpretation.

 I don't think anybody in the humanities talks about truth in this way.

> the study objects in the humanities are normative in the sense that they are objects of value and meaning

 hmm, what notion of 'normativity' is he employing here? why is he equating normative with value and meaning?

> whereas this is not the case in many of the natural and biomedical sciences.

 HPS and STS scholars would fight anybody who says this.

> Molecules, laws of nature, diseases, and the like lack that specific sort of meaning and value.38

 wtf. no.

> However, this point is not relevant for the issue of replication. This can be seen by considering, on the one hand, a scenario in which knowledge about value and meaning is not possible and, on the other, a scenario in which knowledge about value and meaning is possible. First, imagine that it is impossible to uncover knowledge about objects with value and meaning and specifically about those aspects of those objects that concern value and meaning. One may think, for instance, that there are no such facts about value and meaning39 or that they are all socially constructed, so that it would not be right to say that the humanities can uncover them.40 This is, of course, a controversial issue. Here, I will not delve into this complex issue, which would merit a paper or more of its own. Rather, I would like to point out that if it is indeed impossible to uncover knowledge about value

 Ok, is he saying that the notion of working, using, acknowleding, reflecting, and creating value and meaning in the humanities is a problem in itself? Watdafak.

> and meaning, then that is a problem for the humanities in general, and not specifically for the issue of replication in the humanities. For, if there is no value and meaning, or if all value and meaning is socially constructed and the humanities can, therefore, not truly uncover value and meaning, one may rightly wonder to what extent humanistic scholarship as an academic discipline is still possible.



> Then, it seems possible to uncover such knowledge and understanding about the aspects that involve value and meaning multiple times for the same or similar objects. And that would mean that in that case, it would very well be possible to carry out a replication study that involves conclusions about value and meaning.

 IF HE IS EQUATING REPLICATION TO 'MULTIPLE TIMES', WHAT HAVE HISTORIANS BEEN DOING IF NOT REPLICATION BY STUDYING THE SAME PEOPLE, OBJECTS, PHENOMENA. ...

> I conclude that three main reasons for thinking that replication is not possible in the humanities do not hold water.



> I conclude that three main reasons for thinking that replication is not possible in the humanities do not hold water.

 It's a huge assumption to say that these are the reasons why people say it's not possible to do replication in the humanities. He provided no evidence.

> it has time and again been confirmed



> (and thus the successful replication, even though they would not have used that word)


! important !  


This could reflect a given context-dependency of the words and concepts that we use, therefore: [[we need to explain the historical context in which the 'replication crisis', and specially, the push to enourage replication studies in the natural science emerged]]

> Certainly, it is not at all common to speak of a “replication crisis” in the case of the humanities, in contrast to some of the quantitative empirical sciences. As various philosophers, such as Martha Nussbaum,47 have argued, though, there is at least a crisis in the humanities in the sense that they are relatively widely thought of as having a low epistemic status. They are thought to be not nearly as reliable as the sciences and not to provide any robust knowledge. To give just one example, according to American philosopher of science Alex Rosenberg: When it comes to real understanding, the humanities are nothing we have to take seriously, except as symptoms. But they are everything we need to take seriously when it comes to entertainment, enjoyment, and psychological satisfaction. Just don’t treat them as knowledge or wisdom.48

 Indeed, the objectivist colonising imperialism of some, exists. But now, are replication studies in the humanities going to alleviate this? No. We need to think of context: [[we need to explain the historical context in which the 'replication crisis', and specially, the push to enourage replication studies in the natural science emerged]]

> In any case, there may well be a crisis in how the humanities are perceived. Yet, there does not seem to be a replication crisis—at least, it is usually not framed as such. There may, therefore, be somewhat less of a social and epistemic urge to carry out replication studies in the humanities. However, given the epistemic and pragmatic reasons to do so, carrying out at least some replication studies would be good for the humanities and for how they are publicly perceived

 Interesting but I doubt it.
