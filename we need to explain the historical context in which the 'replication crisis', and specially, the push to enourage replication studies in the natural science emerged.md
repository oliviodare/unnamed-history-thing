# we need to explain the historical context in which the 'replication crisis', and specially, the push to enourage replication studies in the natural science emerged
#conceptnote



We may find that the perceived need for (more) replication studies in the natural sciences (especially in psychology) came from the interaction of various factors, such as a response to a perceived generalised obsession with novel and suprising results, speed of research and publishing, and a given mechanism of constructing legitimacy through a particular relationship with the public. We may find that this contexts, which determine a specific notion of 'replicability', designed to alleviate certain fears and promote hopes for changes within research, are actually different in the humanities, and thus the concept of 'replication' cannot be exported *as such*, because it drags a given disciplinary historical context which is in fact different between the natural sciences or the humanities.
