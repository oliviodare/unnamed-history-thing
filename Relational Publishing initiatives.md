# Relational/traceable publishing initiatives

List of already existing open science/scholarship initiatives which have a relational approach to knowledge-making.


## Libscie/ScienceEquals/Hypergraph

https://libscie.org/ has an initiative called [Science=](https://scienceequals.com), formerly called [hypergraph](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz), which wants to divide up research into what they call "modules".
The goal is to 
 - a) create a smaller unit of research than the academic paper
 - b) encourage reusability
 - c) provide a publishing platform independent of large journals

This initiative has some family-resemblance with "our" idea of traceable scholarship, in the sense of supplanting the traditional idea of a paper with a more relational one, but differs with "our" idea by changing the research output itself, while we are more focussed on making the production process more open.


## Octopus

https://science-octopus.org/publications/search?phrase=

Somewhat similar to Libscie, aims to provide a platform to publish research "modules". Very natural science focused, and seems dead.

Developed by Mozilla and eLife

## OpenAire

https://explore.openaire.eu/

More of a data aggregrator than a publishing platform (although it also is that) which aims to expose more kinds of research products than "the paper". 

## ScienceVerse

https://github.com/scienceverse/scienceverse/
By our favourite guy Daniel Lakens. Seems to be a way to generate rich metadata which is easily findable, as long as it is "hypothesis-testing"

## Underlay

https://notes.knowledgefutures.org/pub/underlay-short-intro/release/1
Super vague, enormously ambitious project by a sister project of pubpub. Aims to make a knowlegde graph of ALL facts. Apparently Google already has something like this, they use this, among other things, to get those little previews you see if you google, say, a person's age.
