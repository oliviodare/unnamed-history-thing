# Relational/traceable publishing initiatives

List of already existing open science/scholarship initiatives which have a relational approach to knowledge-making.


## Libscie/ScienceEquals/Hypergraph

https://libscie.org/ has an initiative called [Science=](https://scienceequals.com), formerly called [hypergraph](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz), which wants to divide up research into what they call "modules".
The goal is to 
 - a) create a smaller unit of research than the academic paper
 - b) encourage reusability
 - c) provide a publishing platform independent of large journals

This initiative has some family-resemblance with "our" idea of traceable scholarship, in the sense of supplanting the traditional idea of a paper with a more relational one, but differs with "our" idea by changing the research output itself, while we are more focussed on making the production process more open.
