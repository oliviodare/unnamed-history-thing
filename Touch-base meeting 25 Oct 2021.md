# Touch-base meeting 25 Oct 2021

### Martijn
- tracing intepretation to the original source: linking thoughts of sources with archives, files, and scans
- systematization of historical note-taking
- reproducibility/replicating historical research?


### Thomas
- from single file of notes to zettlekasten appraoach.
- Roam vs open-source app for note-taking
- graphics as a tool to organize individual notes
- zettlekasten as a method to improve productivity
	- a trial and error process of making the method work
- applying the method and tools of open-source development to academic research: 
	- visualizing the research process itself
	- how decisions and changes are made  
	- beyond showing only the end-product (i.e., paper)


### Max
- interested in bigger question: what does it mean to do open history/open scholarship in the humanities?
- appropiating tools (open-source, github) and concepts (open science, replicability) from the natural sciences
- instead of seeing it as a problem of policing, but as a possibily for collaborative work
	- making 'interpretation' and the researcher as an individual the center of academic debate


### Discussion
- three levels: the highly structure of archives and documents, the highly connected secondary/theoretical reading with emerging structures, and the in-between: the concept notes (descriptive) that allow to make the link.
- thinking about OS in humanities not in terms of (replication) crisis, but (re-)traceability
- making sources and interpretation intelligible 
- link between a technology and politics of research

### Getting pragmatic
- Periodic meetings
- Publishing
	- pre-print
- Article content
	- Case-studies
	- Providing technical know-how: starting kit and tools necesary
	- Contribution to the debates of open scholarship in the humanities and replication
- Next meeting
	- November 15th, 14h00
	- Martijn: articles on open scholarship and quantitiative methods in the humanities
	- Thomas: different kinds of implementation of making research open and 'networky'/'relational'.
	- Max: sharing Github, obsidian templates, workflow.
