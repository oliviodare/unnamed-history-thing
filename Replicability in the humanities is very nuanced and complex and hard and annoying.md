# Replicability in the humanities is very nuanced and complex and hard and annoying

There have been many discussions about whether the humanities suffer or are prone to the replication crisis that has touched (better word) the social sciences, which have lead to even more papers discussing what it even mean for qualitative research to be replicable [@Peels2019], with little to no consensus being made on what  qualitative replication *is*. What seems to be clear, however, is that *if* it is sensible to speak of replication in the humanites, it is rather different (wow good word) in nature from the (quantitative) social and natural sciences [@deRijcke2018], and the discussion from the latter cannot simply be transplanted to the former without, for instance, taking into account [[we need to explain the historical context in which the 'replication crisis', and specially, the push to enourage replication studies in the natural science emerged | the historical context from which it originated.]]

Replicability is a spectrum [@Peels2019]
